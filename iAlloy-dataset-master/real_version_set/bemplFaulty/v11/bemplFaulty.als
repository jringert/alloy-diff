/*

The specification
-----------------

We consider 3 classes:
- Persons
- Keys
- Rooms

There is one room in particular: the secure_lab.

The class of Persons is partitioned into 2 non-overlapping subclasses:
- Employees
- Researchers

We make the following assumptions:

1. Each person owns a set of Keys. 

2. For each Key there is one Employee who authorized it being given out.

3. For each Key there is one Room opened_by it.

4. A Person can_enter a Room only if the Room is opened_by a Key the Person owns.

The assertion
--------------
 
Here is the assertion that we thought would be true:

* Each person that can_enter the secure_lab is a Researcher.
